Problem
  One of the solutions assumes I know the owner password, and I don't.
Solution
  1) Shut off the machine. Reboot will not do. Power it down.
  2) Boot the machine and enter the BIOS.
  3) In the BIOS, find "Clear TPM chip" and run that.
  4) Boot the OS and start from scratch with tpm_takeownership.

Problem
  Key not found in persistent storage.

  Did you reboot after clearing/taking ownership? Try that first.

Problem
  stpm-keygen -o my.key
  Tspi_Context_LoadKeyByUUID: Code=0x00002020: tcs: Key not found in persistent storage
Solution
  Is the TPM chip active? Check with tpm_getpubek. If it says it's
  inactive you may need to turn it on in the BIOS. If that doesn't
  work, try clearing it and starting from scratch.

  The base library trousers saves some part of the key on the local filesystem.
