.SH "NAME"
stpm\-sign \- Sign data using the TPM chip
.PP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBstpm\-sign\fP [ \-hs ] \-k \fIkey file\fP \-f \fIinput file\fP
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIstpm\-sign\fP takes the SRK\-encrypted key blob and has the TPM sign the
contents of \fIinput file\fP using the key\&.
.PP 
This program is mostly made for debugging, to make sure that the TPM
is set up correctly and a valid key was generated\&.
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\-h"
Show usage info\&.
.IP "\-f \fIinput file\fP"
File containing data to be signed\&.
.IP "\-k"
Key to sign with\&. The key is generated with \fIstpm\-keygen\fP\&.
.IP "\-s"
Ask for the SRK password interactively\&. By default the
\(dq\&Well Known Secret\(dq\& (20 nulls) is used\&. The SRK password is an
access token that must be presented for the TPM to perform any
operation that involves the TPM, and an actual secret password
is usually not required or useful\&.

Enter key PIN: my secret password here
.PP 
stpm\-sign \-sk ~/\&.simple\-tpm\-pk11/my\-PIN\-key\&.key \-f my\-data\-here

Enter key PIN: my secret password here

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
Most errors will probably be related to interacting with the TPM chip\&.
Resetting the TPM chip and taking ownership should take care of most
of them\&. See the \fITPM\-TROUBLESHOOTING\fP section of
\fBsimple\-tpm\-pk11(7)\fP\&.
