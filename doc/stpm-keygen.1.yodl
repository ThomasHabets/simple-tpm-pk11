    bf(stpm-keygen) [ -hps ] -o em(output file)

manpagedescription()
    em(stpm-keygen) generates a 2048 RSA key inside the TPM chip, and saves
    the public key and the SRK-encrypted key blob in the
    em(output file).

manpageoptions()
startdit()
    dit(-h) Show usage info.
    dit(-o em(output file)) Output file, where the public key and key blob
        will be written.
    dit(-p) Create the key with a PIN / password. The password will
        be prompted for inteactively.
    dit(-s) Ask for the SRK password interactively. By default the
        "Well Known Secret" (20 nulls) is used. The SRK password is an
        access token that must be presented for the TPM to perform any
        operation that involves the TPM, and an actual secret password
        is usually not required or useful.
    dit(-S) Generate key in software instead of hardware.
        The choice between generating the key in software and hardware is
        not an obvious one. It's hard to verify the quality of keys generated
        in hardware (e.g. bugs or backdoors), but software keys have existed
        in RAM at some point. And because software generated keys have to be generated as
        migratable keys, they can be extracted by someone who knows the TPM owner
        password. The recommended choice is to generate in hardware, which
        is also the default.

manpagediagnostics()
    Most errors will probably be related to interacting with the TPM chip.
    Resetting the TPM chip and taking ownership should take care of most
    of them. See the em(TPM-TROUBLESHOOTING) section of
    bf(simple-tpm-pk11(7)).
