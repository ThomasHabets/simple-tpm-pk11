## Install dependencies

### Debian
```shell
apt-get install tpm-tools libtspi-dev libopencryptoki-dev libssl-dev
```

### Fedora
```shell
tpm-tools
opencryptoki-devel
trousers-devel
openssl-devel
```

### FreeBSD
```shell
pkg install tpm-tools trousers-tddl opencryptoki openssl
```

## Build simple-tpm-pk11
```shell
./configure && make && sudo make install
```


## Init TPM chip
1. If you have not taken ownership, do so.
```shell
tpm_takeownership -z
Enter owner password: [enter something secret here]
Confirm password: [enter something secret here]
```

2. SRK password is usually the Well Known Secret (all nulls). You can
   specify a password but it's easier it you don't. The SRK password is only
   used to allow crypto operations. You still need blobs and key passwords to
   use other peoples keys.
   
   The "SRK password" is needed to be able to do operations with the "SRK",
   which is the actual cryptographic key. The user has no access to the SRK
   directly. The same goes for other keys protected by the TPM chip.
```shell
tpm_changeownerauth -s -r
```

If you get any error messages, see read TPM-TROUBLESHOOTING.

## User setup

### 1. Create key
```
mkdir ~/.simple-tpm-pk11/
stpm-keygen -o ~/.simple-tpm-pk11/my.key
```

(use `-p` if you want to set a password on the key)

Try out the key:
```
dd if=/dev/urandom of=to-sign bs=1 count=35
stpm-sign -k ~/.simple-tpm-pk11/my.key -f to-sign
stpm-sign -k ~/.simple-tpm-pk11/my.key -f to-sign -r > to-sign.sig
stpm-verify -f to-sign -k ~/.simple-tpm-pk11/my.key -s to-sign.sig
```

### 2. Create config
```
echo "key my.key" > ~/.simple-tpm-pk11/config
```

Optionally add "log foo.log" in there too.


### 3. Extract the public key in SSH format
```
ssh-keygen -D libsimple-tpm-pk11.so
```

Install it where you want to log in, in the usual authorized_keys way.

Try logging in using your new fancy key:
```
ssh -I libsimple-tpm-pk11.so shell.example.com
```

### 4. Configure SSH to always use this module
Add this to `~/.ssh/config`:
```
Host *
      PKCS11Provider libsimple-tpm-pk11.so
```

then try:
```shell
ssh shell.example.com
```

### 4a. Alternatively, add the TPM to your `ssh-agent`

This has to be the OpenSSH `ssh-agent`, since gnome-keyring doesn't support
PKCS#11. A sign that you run gnome-keyring (or your OpenSSH is compiled
without PKCS#11 support) is that you see this error message when you try:

```
$ ssh-add -s /â€¦/libsimple-tpm-pk11.so
Enter passphrase for PKCS#11: 
Could not add card "/â€¦/libsimple-tpm-pk11.so": agent refused operation
```

### Software
* OpenSSH 5.9
* OpenSSH 6.0p1 on Debian 7.2
* OpenSSH 6.4p1 on CentOS 7.0
* OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 on FreeBSD 11-CURRENT
* OpenSSH 6.8p1 on Arch Linux
* OpenSSH 7.1p2 on Debian

## TODO
* Clean up code.
* config option: log to stdout and/or stderr in addition to logfile.
* Install in the correct place.
* Add PKCS11 support to ssh *server*.
* Global config in /etc.
* Optionally stir with /dev/random when generating keys.
* Script to automate setting up, including verifying TPM state and fixing it.
* Auto-generate keys on demand? Or should this only be part of script to set up?
* Make it work with gpg, and document.
* Make it work with SSH certs, and document.
* Make it work with openssl, and document.
* Make it work with Firefox, and document.
* Make it work with Chrome, and document.
* Make it work with encrypted home directories, and document.

## Some random notes, not instructions
```shell
openssl genrsa -out rsa-key 2048
openssl rsa -in rsa-key -modulus
exponent is always 65537.
ssh-keygen -f rsa-key -y > rsa-key.pub
```
